simpleQC is a cli app to aid with quality control for high-throughput sequqencing data. It is fast and can handle your entire fastq files in a single command. The app can check a single file, multiple files in a folder, or tranverse nested directories to find compressed fastq files. 

# State of The Code
The code is fully working as intended, but it is still at the early stage. Please, expect constant re-structuring and refactoring. Currently, it only supports compressed fastq files. Fasta support is coming and potentially will add wrapper for fastqc to simplify QC workflow.
